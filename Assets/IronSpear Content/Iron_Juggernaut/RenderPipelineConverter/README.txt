Hi! 

to convert Materials to URP click on BuiltIn to URO  

the same with HDRP

If some materials look pink like hair or thin cloth it means they didnt converted automaticaly because it they are build on custom shader.
You will need to manually select material and choose URP or HDRP default lit Material and enable 2 sided shading and place textures if needed.
